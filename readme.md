# Calculator

![Windows](https://github.com/Bazik33/Calculator/workflows/Windows/badge.svg) <br />
A simple .NET Calculator, and by the way my first WPF Project :)

# How to run it

(1) `git clone` this repo.  <br />
(2) Load Calculator.sln with your favourite Windows .NET IDE (MS Visual Studio, Rider by JetBrains, etc. - remember that you'll need .NET Framework SDK) <br />
(3) Start debugging and that's it! <br />
